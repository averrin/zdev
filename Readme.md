TODO:
=====
* fix registration/profile navigation issues
* refactor template names and named url
* clean not used static files
* update filters in releases.total_list on filter()
* Fix releases proc logic on update
* Change raw queries to prepared statements or models over existing database
* System for uploading tasks on pandora servers (task num and two buttons: upload to Abra, upload to Pandora). imho, xml-rpc - good solution.
* refactor less, move css hotfixes in style tags to less
